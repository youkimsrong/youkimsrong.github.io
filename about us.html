	<h1>About Us</h1>
<div><p>AllMovie was founded by popular-culture archivist Michael Erlewine, who also founded AllMusic and AllGame.
The AllMovie database was licensed to tens of thousands of distributors and retailers for point-of-sale systems, websites and kiosks. The AllMovie database is comprehensive, including basic product information, cast and production credits, plot synopsis, professional reviews, biographies, relational links and more.
AllMovie data was accessed on the web at the AllMovie.com website. It was also available via the AMG LASSO media recognition service, which can automatically recognize DVDs.
In late 2007, Macrovision (now Rovi Corporation) acquired AMG for a reported $72 million.[5]
The AMG consumer facing web properties AllMusic.com, AllMovie.com and AllGame.com were sold by Rovi in August 2013 to All Media Network, LLC. The buyers also include the original founders of SideReel and Ackrell Capital investor Mike Ackrell.[6]RhythmOne offices are located in San Francisco, California, and Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States.Filmweb was created by Artur Gortych, and launched on March 18, 1998. On January 20, 2000, it became the first Polish website available through Wireless Application Protocol. In 2005, Filmweb PRO (aimed at entertainment professionals) was launched.
On May 20, 2010, the beta version of the website was launched,[3] and Filmweb also started to use a new algorithm, called Gustomierz (Tastemeter). Registered users, that have rated at least 50 movies, are able to see how much particular movie is supposed to be liked by them and to find taste similar users. The engine was based on KNN and SVD theories, as well as Filmweb's own studies.[4] The technology is still improved by expressly appointed computer scientists team.[4] On September 16, 2010, a new design of the database home page was launched.[3][5] On January 18, 2011, video games were added to the database.
The first Filmweb mobile application, for iOS, premiered in November 2011. It was followed by the release of an Android app on February 4, 2012,[6] and a Windows Phone app in March 2012.[7]</p></div>
